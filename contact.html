                        <p> Originally from California, I moved to Austin in the summer of 2012 to persue a more fulfilling life.
                        I've been a cosmetologist for the last 10 years, and I have absolutely loved it, but I always knew there 
                        was something I would rather be doing instead.
                        I went down many career options but landed at a dead end realizing that those things would also have an expiration date on
                        happiness. One thing above everything always stood out though. Software developement, and website design. I loved learning different languages.
                        and it was the one thing that always made my brain happy.</p>
        
                        <p>I hope that with my new knowledge from The Coding Bootcamp at UT, I can successfly get a job that I can learn more from,
                        and also add my skills to a company that would value me as an employee. I also would love to help small business owners grow
                        their business by building a fully functional website. Helping small businesses would be very fullfulling, because
                        the one thing I can take away from my years as a cosmetologist is I love to help people. I love to see people succeed, and when 
                        you have confidence, so many things are possible. Having confidence in a good website for potentional clients, is something 
                        every business should have. </p>
