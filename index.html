                            <p> Originally from California, I moved to Austin in the summer of 2012 to pursue a more fulfilling life.
                            I've been a cosmetologist for the last 10 years, and I have absolutely loved it, but I always knew there 
                            was something I would rather be doing instead.
                            I went down many career options but landed at a dead end realizing that those things would also have an expiration date on
                            happiness. One thing above everything always stood out though. Software development, and website design. I loved learning different languages.
                            and it was the one thing that always made my brain happy.</p>
            
                            <p>I hope that with my new knowledge from The Coding Bootcamp at UT, I can successfully get a job that I can learn more from,
                            and also add my skills to a company that would value me as an employee. I also would love to help small business owners grow
                            their business by building a fully functional website. Helping small businesses would be very fulfilling, because
                            the one thing I can take away from my years as a cosmetologist is I love to help people. I love to see people succeed, and when 
                            you have confidence, so many things are possible. Having confidence in a good website for potential clients, is something 
                            every business should have. </p>
